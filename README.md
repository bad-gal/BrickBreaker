Created in Ruby using GOSU library

***The Idea***

There are rows of bricks on the screen. The aim of the game is to 
destroy all the bricks with a ball that travels up and down the screen.
 
A brick is destroyed when it is hit by the ball. The ball bounces off when it
collides with the screen border, bricks or the paddle. The player must avoid 
the ball touching the bottom of the screen, the player must use the paddle 
to bounce the ball upwards, keeping the ball in play.

Your score increases with each brick you destroy. You have 3 lives and you lose
a life each time the ball falls off the screen.

***Paddle movement***

The paddle moves left and right using the arrow keys.
